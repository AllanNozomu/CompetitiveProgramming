## Work in progress

I am developing some scripts in order to get my AC solutions from this platforms.
- [x] Leetcode - The leetcode folder was completely script generated 
- [x] UVa (I think it is impossible)
- [ ] URI
- [ ] Codeforces

Also I would like to create a better website to show my code in a better structured way, maybe with Hugo or Jekyll.
